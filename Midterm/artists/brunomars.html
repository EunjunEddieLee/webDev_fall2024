                        <p>
                          Oh, her eyes, her eyes
                          Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
                          Her hair, her hair
                          Falls perfectly without her tryin'
                          She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
                          Yeah, I know, I know
                          When I compliment her, she won't believe me
                          And it's so, it's so
                          Sad to think that she don't see what I see
                          But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
                          I say

                          When I see your face
                          There's not a thing that I would change
                          'Cause you're amazing
                          Just the way you are
                          And when you smile
                          The whole world stops and stares for a while
                          'Cause girl, you're amazing
                          Just the way you are
                          Yeah

                          Her lips, her lips
                          I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
                          Her laugh, her laugh
                          She hates, but I think it's so sexy
                          She's so beautiful and I tell her everyday
                          Oh, you know, you know
                          You know I'd never ask you to change
                          If perfect's what you're searchin' for, then just stay the same
                          So don't even bother askin' if you look okay
                          You know I'll say

                          When I see your face
