                          I will always remember
                          The day you kissed my lips
                          Light as a feather
                          And it went just like this
                          No, it's never been better
                          Than the summer of 2002 (ooh)
                          Uh, we were only eleven
                          But acting like grown-ups
                          Like we are in the present
                          Drinking from plastic cups
                          Singing, "Love is forever and ever"
                          Well, I guess that was true

                          Dancing on the hood in the middle of the woods
                          On an old Mustang, where we sang
                          Songs with all our childhood friends
                          And it went like this, say

                          Oops, I got 99 problems singing bye, bye, bye
                          Hold up, if you wanna go and take a ride with me
                          Better hit me, baby, one more time, uh
                          Paint a picture for you and me
                          On the days when we were young, uh
                          Singing at the top of both our lungs

                          Now we're under the covers
                          Fast forward to eighteen
                          We are more than lovers
                          Yeah, we are all we need
                          When we're holding each other
                          I'm taken back to 2002 (ooh)
                          Yeah

                        <p>
                          Call it love and devotion
                          Call it the mom's adoration (foundation)
                          A special bond of creation, hah
                          For all the single moms out there
                          Going through frustration
                          Clean Bandit, Sean-Da-Paul, Anne-Marie, sing, make them hear

                          She works the night by the water
                          She's gone astray, so far away from her father's daughter
                          She just wants a life for her baby
                          All on her own, no one will come
                          She's got to save him (daily struggle)

                          She tells him, "Ooh, love
                          No one's ever gonna hurt you, love"
                          "I'm gonna give you all of my love"
                          "Nobody matters like you" (stay up there, stay up there)
                          She tells him, "Your life ain't gonna be nothing like my life" (straight)
                          "You're gonna grow and have a good life"
                          "I'm gonna do what I got to do" (stay up there, stay up there)

                          So, rockabye, baby, rockabye

                          I'm all right with me
                          Sunday mornings
                          In my own bedsheets
                          I've been waking up alone
                          I haven't thought of her for days
                          I'll be honest
                          It's better off this way
                          But every time I think that I can get you out my head
                          You never, ever let me forget
                          'Cause
                          Just when I think you're gone
                          Hear our song on the radio
                          Just like that, takes me back
                          To the places we used to go
                          And I've been trying but I just can't fight it
                          When I hear it, I just can't stop smiling
                          I remember you're gone
                          Baby, it's just a song on the radio
                          That we used to know
                          I'll be honest
                          I'm all right with me
                          Sunday mornings
                          In my own white tee
                          I've been waking up alone
                          I haven't thought of him for days
                          I'll be honest
                          It's better off this way
                          Every time I think that I can get you out my head
                          You never, ever let me forget
